作為一個開發向的IT狗，應該要對一些DevOps技術有實踐上的認知，所以我把自身的經驗寫下來。希望可以有一個整體上的實踐方案以供討論和改進。

雖然我覺得願意看的人不多，看完後願意試的人更少，試完願意分享意見和改進的更希少。如果你是那個少少少少的希有人群，有興趣可以在github提交修正。

As of a programmer, we should not only focus on source code development. We need to take a look about the DevOps workflow, and choose some suitable technology to ehance our working process (and the final product). Therefore, I write down notes and hope it could be structural enough to be compaired or discussed, and hopefully to improve that.

I don't think much people would like to read these articles. But if you are the special geek, please join and help to improve the articles in Github.
